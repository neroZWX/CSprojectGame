## About this project
This is a LAN game about FPS. Before we start the game, we must have the available servers, otherwise we cannot run the game. So the player can create a client( must type  IP address as your servers ) or connect the existing client, and then generate a role on the game map (the game is a 3D game so the map is 3D, with X, Y, Z three coordinates), the player can control the role of a series of movements, such as running, jumping, forward, backward, rotating, and so on. It can also control the role of a weapon to fire, attack other players, each player controls the role of HP, when the HP value is 0, the game character dies, and the Game-Over interface will appear. The production of this game is the most popular development software unity3d engine. For LAN games, the unity3d game engine contains a lot of development originals and API, developers can not use other development software, all development tools and component unity3d are included.
